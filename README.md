Calculator with React

* In this project I built a modern application, a calculator similar to the one that appears on our phones. With this, I would like to demonstrate some skills that I got with this famous framework called React.

* I needed to create a project similar to the course introduction to Front-End Developer(From Meta provided by Coursera). Now, to include it in my portfolio, I decided to modify it by creating my style.

* You can check in this GitHub repository the code which appears inside the Calculator folder. For made it,I used Visual Studio Code.

I hope you like this!
